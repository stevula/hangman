# Hangman
A text-based version of Hangman that I made for the terminal.

# Features
* Random selections from a dictionary of over 60,000 words (thanks to [http://scrapmaker.com/](http://scrapmaker.com/.) 
for the dictionary!)
* Easily restart from within the program after you win or die. 
* See which letters you have already guessed. You will not be penalized for 
accidentally guessing the same one twice.
* Guess limit is automatically adjusted based on the length of the word.

# Installation
* Clone the repo to the desired location on your hard drive.
* Navigate to the hangman directory in the terminal.
* Run hangman.rb with the command: ``` ruby hangman.rb ```
